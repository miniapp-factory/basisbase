#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you’re asking for will touch only a couple of files in the repository:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – to update the app’s title and description to reflect the new Binance‑Chain leasing/profit‑sharing concept.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – to generate a new logo that represents the Binance‑Chain, leasing, profit‑sharing, and Islamic‑compliance theme.  

These are the only files that need to be edited to satisfy the request. Let me know when you’d like me to add them to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I will need to edit `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and create a new file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.  
Please add `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` to the chat so I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

The changes you’re asking for will touch only two files in the repository:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – to update the app’s title and description.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – to generate a new logo that represents the Binance‑Chain leasing/profit‑sharing concept.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
